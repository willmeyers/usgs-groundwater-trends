## Reading this Plot

Each line represents a USGS groundwater site. In summary:

- A red line pointing downwards shows groundwater levels trending downward.
- A blue line pointint upwards shows groundwater levels trending upward.
- The length of the line represents the median rate of change (a long line means a fast rate of change).

## Methodology

Trends were calculated using [Mann Kendall](https://wikitia.com/wiki/Mann-Kendall_trend_test) and [Theil-Sen regressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theilâ€“Sen_estimator). Data was sourced from USGS.
